# Creases :shirt:

Tools for efficiently folding markdown sections in Obsidian.

![creases-overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/156103767-33f311de-39ac-422d-b8ea-987ea9c63f7b.png)

Add `%% fold %%` markers to "crease" your markdown. Then run **Fold along creases** to get your file into the state you want.

## Commands

- **Toggle Crease** ‚Äì Create/uncrease the current section that you're in
- **Fold along creases** ‚Äì Fold all the creased sections of your file
- **Fold headings by level** ‚Äì Fold all headings in the correct document that match a given level (H1 - H6)
- **Iron out the creases** ‚Äì Remove all the creases from the current file
- **Crease the current folds** ‚Äì Applies a crease to the current folds in the file, allowing you to easily get back to these current folds using **fold along creases**.

## Additional Features

_Coming Soon_ Use creaes to have folds in your [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) templates. Your `%% fold %%` markers will start folded.
