# Creases :shirt:

Tools for efficiently folding markdown sections in Obsidian.

![creases-overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/156103767-33f311de-39ac-422d-b8ea-987ea9c63f7b.png)

Add `%% fold %%` markers to "crease" your markdown. Then run **Fold along creases** to get your file into the state you want.

## Commands

- **Toggle Crease** – Create/uncrease the current section that you're in
- **Fold along creases** – Fold all the creased sections of your file
- **Fold headings by level** – Fold all headings in the correct document that match a given level (H1 - H6)
- **Iron out the creases** – Remove all the creases from the current file
- **Crease the current folds** – Applies a crease to the current folds in the file, allowing you to easily get back to these current folds using **fold along creases**.

## Additional Features

_Coming Soon_ **Templater Support** – Add creases to your [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) templates to have content automatically folded.
